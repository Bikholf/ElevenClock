# Translate ElevenClock
Since ElevenClock is an app that wants to reach every single person in the world running Windows 11 and 2 or more monitors, on issue [#111](https://github.com/martinet101/ElevenClock/issues/111) it was requested to add this feature. And here we are.

## How to contribute
This is the translation program. The language packs will be .py files containing a dictionary with the translated sentences. 

## Adding a new language
To translate ElevenClock to a language, download [this](https://github.com/martinet101/ElevenClock/blob/main/elevenclock/lang/lang_sample.py) file, translate every sentence and submit a pull request. If you don't know how to, just email me the file at [marticlilop@gmail.com](mailto:marticlilop@gmail.com). I'll review it and publish it with the new version.

## Updating/improving a language translation
Open a pull request with the suggested changes. I'll review it and publish the update with the next version.

## Rules:
 - Make sure to add any final stop/colon/semicolon/hyphen/etc.
 - Make sure to add the {0} symbols, since they code for variable values
 - If  you are creating a new translation, you can give you credits in a specific place (marked in the file). If you update a language file, you can also add your credits but without removing the previous one. Thi could be acieved by writing something like "Translated to Catalan by @user1 and @user2"
Example of the translation to catalan:<br>
